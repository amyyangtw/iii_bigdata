I love everything about the DivaCup: Saving money on tampons, keeping waste out of landfills, leaving the cup in for 12 hours without worrying about toxic shock, the ease of use in the backcountry... I could go on! Yes, initially it does take some getting used to. The first time you use it, you may panic and fear that you won't be able to get the cup out. It's okay. Just realize you may have to reach into places you may have not reached before and your hands will get dirty. Once you become more comfortable and competent with the product, you won't have these problems anymore. Stick with it and I promise you that this will totally change the way you experience your period. I have been using this product for over two years and wish more people knew about it. Honestly life changing.\", \"This might be a long review but I have to say that this is amazing! There is a learning curve with it and I'll admit at first I was getting discouraged because with my first two cycles with the diva cup, I had leaks. Removing it for the first time felt like I was pulling out my insides because I didn't break the seal properly lol I just couldn't seem to get it right no matter what I did. However, with more practice, I noticed near the end of my second cycle the leaks disappeared and by the third cycle with the cup, I had not a single leak!!!!!! It was an amazing feeling to not use a single tampon or pad and be able to go 12 hours without changing anything! I researched different folds and methods that could work and I finally figured out the proper placement for my body to avoid leaks. I'm thrilled!! And would highly recommend it! My advice would be to be patient! Keep practicing! At first I thought it was never going to be a success for me and I've had complete success with my third cycle with the diva cup.\", \"If you've been considering making the change to the Diva Cup, don't think anymore and just do it! I bought my Diva Cup and put off using it for almost a YEAR because of how nervous I was to make the transition from tampons. I've now been using the cup for the past 5 months, and I have been raving about it to all of my girlfriends. No wet tampon string to mess with, no worrying about keeping it in for too long, no risk of TSS, no negative environmental effects, no more post-period yeast infections; the Diva Cup has completed changed my mentality around my periods. Once you get past the initial learning curve, there is no denying how fantastic this product is. Insert, remove, empty, and pop back in! Wear a panty liner to catch any leaks (especially when you're first learning how to use it) and you're good to go. I can't say enough good things about it - I am completely converted!\"]}, {'keyword': 'Menstrual Cup, Model 2 feminine care', 'name': 'FLEX Menstrual Cup SLIM Fit + 2 FREE Menstrual Discs', 'brand': 'flex', 'url': 'https://www.target.com/p/flex-menstrual-cup-slim-fit-2-free-menstrual-discs/-/A-75665026', 'pic': 'https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_98f28e3a-dca2-4a55-8321-8b619aa54eff', 'price': 39.99, 'category': ['Personal Care', 'Feminine Products'], 'star_ratings': [4.46, 85], 'other_ratings': {'odorControl': 4.78, 'Quality': 4.5, 'comfort_1': 4.0, 'Value': 4.44, 'absorbency': 4.88}, 'at_a_glance': 'NA', 'highlights': ['Ultimate Comfort: Velvety-soft, form-fitting material made to fit most bodies.', 'Made to fit your body: If your cup doesn’t fit, reach out to hello@flexfits.com.

Especially at night I was able to sleep comfortably and in the morning empty it out and start all over. I would recommend this for anyone who has had children and is a person on the go.', 'I’ve only ever used tampons before, but was really attracted to the idea of not worrying about having to change something out for 12 whole hours! I like the design of the Flex Cup more than other cups in the market because of the easy pull string that breaks the seal for you instead of having to break the seal myself...way less messy. So far, I’ve loved it!! And it’s much MUCH more cost-effective over time, totally worth the investment. Wearing a cup has lived up to the hype. The first three days were super uncomfortable to put the cup in place, but my body adjusted just fine and I figured out better ways to fold it. It really is less gross overall than pads and tampons, let me tell you, and you do feel so much cleaner throughout your period! And it reduces cramps, too. I love that I’m not creating landfill waste, too, with single-use products. No leaks or issues yet other than the first few days of discomfort...every person will find a way to fold the cup for easy insertion that’s best for their body. I haven’t tried the Flex discs yet, but I’m really enjoying my cup so far!', 'I only bought this for the discs (I used Softdiscs before but they leaked, so I wanted to try these because I hate tampons), but I tried the cup first to see if it would work. I wasn’t expecting much because I had used another brand before and it was too big for me and very uncomfortable. I put this one in overnight and had not a drop of leakage on my heaviest period day. I wore it again for the next 3 days and same deal. I can feel it a little bit when I first move up or down (as opposed to the discs that I can’t feel at all), but the money saving, sustainability, and leak protection make it well worth it. One important note: no your body when you order this. I am 38 years old and have had two children, one within the last year (although both were delivered via C-section), and this is *definitely* the fit for me, not the bigger one. The cup I had used in the past was the post 30 post childbearing size and it didn’t fit well at all.']}, {'keyword': 'Menstrual Cup, Model 2 feminine care', 'name': 'Saalt Menstrual Cup - Himalayan Pink - Small', 'brand': 'Saalt', 'url': 'https://www.target.com/p/saalt-menstrual-cup-himalayan-pink-small/-/A-75663408', 'pic': 'https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_4624b998-a4d2-4ef9-85c7-ff9bd62a5480', 'price': 32.99, 'category': ['Personal Care', 'Feminine Products'], 'star_ratings': [4.87, 79], 'other_ratings': {'absorbency': 4.87, 'comfort_1': 4.76, 'odorControl': 4.89, 'Value': 4.82, 'Quality': 4.98}, 'at_a_glance': 'NA', 'highlights': ['Premium menstrual cup for light to regular flow', '2 to 3 tampon capacity', '12 hours of protection day & night', 'Lasts 10 years', 'Designed for comfort', 'Chemical & toxin free', 'Better for your body & the environment', 'Includes one cup + one carry bag'], 'specifications': {}, 'description': \"The Small Saalt Cup is the perfect starter cup to simplify and improve your period.

So I definitely recommend watching how-to videos to teach you how to insert and remove the cup. I would also highly recommend not trimming the stem if you’re a first time user until you’ve actually gotten the hang of the insertion and removal process (I cut mine too early, not realizing I hadn’t been pushing the cup in all the way although it didn’t cause problems, it did make it a little harder to find at first when I was ready to remove the cup). As messy as the whole “mentrual cup” idea sounds at first, once I started using this product, I realized that it’s actually less messy than using tampons and pads. Not to mention, it’s so much more time efficient because you don’t have to run to the bathroom ever 3 hours just to change it out like a pad or tampon.Overall, this product is phenomenal! I don’t get any cramping. I can’t even tell I’m wearing it. And there’s no leakage! Most of all, I love the fact that this is a great feminine product that reduces environmental waste and the company gives back to other women in need. Tip: you should not be able to feel the cup, if you do, try reinserting it with the punch down fold and make sure to push it pass your PELVIC BONE. If you can feel it, chances are, you didn’t push it in far enough.', \"First of all, get yourself on the Saalt facebook page. People with periods are giving amazing advice on that page.  Pros- 1-great packaging. It makes me happy just to look at it. 2- It totally works3- great instructions4- easy to insert (all the reviews scared the hellouta me, but it was easy peasy lemon squeezie). 5- You don't feel it6- doesn't cause additional cramps even though it's bigger than any tampon I've ever tried. 7- good for the environment. Cons and some advice1- It makes a mess on your hands when you pull it out, it doesn't matter what people say. Be prepared2- It's kind of a challenge to pull out. Now I'm on my first cycle using this, so it may get easier the more experience I have. Advice- don't use lube if it hurts to get out. There's no way of getting it out when it's slippery. Keep the tail on until you are certain you don't need it.3- It makes family members wonder what you're doing in the bathroom as you laugh at the gross sounds that happen while using this thing. 4- Kind of wish it was cheaper.  Saalt's website sells them for a few dollars cheaper with free shipping. I think I might try the new soft version that came out just recently. This one isn't hard or anything, but man it hurts to pull out.  I also first ordered the blue one, and decided to return it and get the pink small. I've had 3 kids but I was still nervous to put something so big up there and expect to not get major cramps. I'm glad I got the small. It has never been full. There you have it. My review about my monthly cycle for all to see.\", 'Bought the cup to reduce environmental waste and save money. If you follow the different techniques for insertion it’s fairly easy, you may need to adjust to have it in more once it’s in so the stem isn’t sticking out as that can be uncomfortable. I don’t feel it at all once it’s in. Also can be uncomfortable to take out just make sure you move side to side and then tip it forward. I wear small and leave it in all day and just clean it when I take a shower, makes it really easy. The best is you clean it then wear it through the night!

There is a learning curve with it and I'll admit at first I was getting discouraged because with my first two cycles with the diva cup, I had leaks. Removing it for the first time felt like I was pulling out my insides because I didn't break the seal properly lol I just couldn't seem to get it right no matter what I did. However, with more practice, I noticed near the end of my second cycle the leaks disappeared and by the third cycle with the cup, I had not a single leak!!!!!! It was an amazing feeling to not use a single tampon or pad and be able to go 12 hours without changing anything! I researched different folds and methods that could work and I finally figured out the proper placement for my body to avoid leaks. I'm thrilled!! And would highly recommend it! My advice would be to be patient! Keep practicing! At first I thought it was never going to be a success for me and I've had complete success with my third cycle with the diva cup.\", \"If you've been considering making the change to the Diva Cup, don't think anymore and just do it! I bought my Diva Cup and put off using it for almost a YEAR because of how nervous I was to make the transition from tampons. I've now been using the cup for the past 5 months, and I have been raving about it to all of my girlfriends. No wet tampon string to mess with, no worrying about keeping it in for too long, no risk of TSS, no negative environmental effects, no more post-period yeast infections; the Diva Cup has completed changed my mentality around my periods. Once you get past the initial learning curve, there is no denying how fantastic this product is. Insert, remove, empty, and pop back in! Wear a panty liner to catch any leaks (especially when you're first learning how to use it) and you're good to go.

I love that I’m not creating landfill waste, too, with single-use products. No leaks or issues yet other than the first few days of discomfort...every person will find a way to fold the cup for easy insertion that’s best for their body.

I wasn’t expecting much because I had used another brand before and it was too big for me and very uncomfortable. I put this one in overnight and had not a drop of leakage on my heaviest period day. I wore it again for the next 3 days and same deal. I can feel it a little bit when I first move up or down (as opposed to the discs that I can’t feel at all), but the money saving, sustainability, and leak protection make it well worth it. One important note: no your body when you order this. I am 38 years old and have had two children, one within the last year (although both were delivered via C-section), and this is *definitely* the fit for me, not the bigger one.

Made in the USA from 100% medical-grade silicone, this chemical and toxin free Saalt Cup can last up to 10 years, diverting waste from landfills and saving you money! Each Saalt Cup comes with a user guide and cute carry pouch. Plus your purchase helps provide period care to women and girls in need. Thank you for (period) caring! \", 'reviews': ['There definitely is a learning curve to using this product or any mentrual cup. So I definitely recommend watching how-to videos to teach you how to insert and remove the cup. I would also highly recommend not trimming the stem if you’re a first time user until you’ve actually gotten the hang of the insertion and removal process (I cut mine too early, not realizing I hadn’t been pushing the cup in all the way although it didn’t cause problems, it did make it a little harder to find at first when I was ready to remove the cup). As messy as the whole “mentrual cup” idea sounds at first, once I started using this product, I realized that it’s actually less messy than using tampons and pads. Not to mention, it’s so much more time efficient because you don’t have to run to the bathroom ever 3 hours just to change it out like a pad or tampon.Overall, this product is phenomenal! I don’t get any cramping. I can’t even tell I’m wearing it. And there’s no leakage! Most of all, I love the fact that this is a great feminine product that reduces environmental waste and the company gives back to other women in need. Tip: you should not be able to feel the cup, if you do, try reinserting it with the punch down fold and make sure to push it pass your PELVIC BONE. If you can feel it, chances are, you didn’t push it in far enough.', \"First of all, get yourself on the Saalt facebook page. People with periods are giving amazing advice on that page.  Pros- 1-great packaging. It makes me happy just to look at it. 2- It totally works3- great instructions4- easy to insert (all the reviews scared the hellouta me, but it was easy peasy lemon squeezie). 5- You don't feel it6- doesn't cause additional cramps even though it's bigger than any tampon I've ever tried. 7- good for the environment. Cons and some advice1- It makes a mess on your hands when you pull it out, it doesn't matter what people say. Be prepared2- It's kind of a challenge to pull out. Now I'm on my first cycle using this, so it may get easier the more experience I have. Advice- don't use lube if it hurts to get out. There's no way of getting it out when it's slippery. Keep the tail on until you are certain you don't need it.3- It makes family members wonder what you're doing in the bathroom as you laugh at the gross sounds that happen while using this thing. 4- Kind of wish it was cheaper.  Saalt's website sells them for a few dollars cheaper with free shipping. I think I might try the new soft version that came out just recently. This one isn't hard or anything, but man it hurts to pull out.  I also first ordered the blue one, and decided to return it and get the pink small. I've had 3 kids but I was still nervous to put something so big up there and expect to not get major cramps. I'm glad I got the small. It has never been full. There you have it. My review about my monthly cycle for all to see.\", 'Bought the cup to reduce environmental waste and save money. If you follow the different techniques for insertion it’s fairly easy, you may need to adjust to have it in more once it’s in so the stem isn’t sticking out as that can be uncomfortable. I don’t feel it at all once it’s in. Also can be uncomfortable to take out just make sure you move side to side and then tip it forward. I wear small and leave it in all day and just clean it when I take a shower, makes it really easy. The best is you clean it then wear it through the night! No more Overnight maxi pads!']}, {'keyword': 'Menstrual Cup, Model 2 feminine care', 'name': 'FLEX Menstrual Cup FULL Fit + 2 FREE Menstrual Discs', 'brand': 'flex', 'url': 'https://www.target.com/p/flex-menstrual-cup-full-fit-2-free-menstrual-discs/-/A-75665024', 'pic': 'https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_a0d3ca5d-358e-4e2e-a4a7-1909b6e18db3', 'price': 39.99, 'category': ['Personal Care', 'Feminine Products'], 'star_ratings': [4.37, 98], 'other_ratings': {'absorbency': 4.0, 'comfort_1': 3.55, 'Value': 3.1, 'Quality': 3.7, 'odorControl': 3.44}, 'at_a_glance': 'NA', 'highlights': ['Ultimate Comfort: Velvety-soft, form-fitting material made to fit most bodies.', 'Made to fit your body: If your cup doesn’t fit, reach out to hello@flexfits.com.

The other cups were a little too hard and uncomfortable for me, but this one is softer than the others, so it is much more comfortable. I've had one child, have an IUD, and my periods are very heavy now. I haven't had leaks when using this cup, unlike the others I have tried.

I thought why not try the cup, just to see if there were any improvements. So glad that I did!! I purchased the \"Full\" size cup (per the Flex recommendations: I\\'m both over 30yo, and have had children). Watch the video about insertion (there are many different folds/methods); I prefer \\'tulip\\' that they mention during the video. I was extra careful my first time with removal - no issues!! Follow the directions and you will be fine. No overnight leaks (bye bye bulky pads!), comfortable, and eased my cramps. I will be buying an extra to keep in my overnight bag so I am always prepared. Easy to use, easy to clean, better for the environment. IF you are skeptical, or unsure about the price...there are periodic (pun) department sales/offers.', \"I have yet to try the disc but the cup is a LIFE CHANGER! I didn't have a period for 17 months after having my baby and once I did, changing tampons constantly was not going to work as a busy mom. I'm so glad I switch. You really can keep this in for 12 hours and have no leaks at all. I was skeptical and wore liners for the heavier days and NOTHING.

Honestly life changing.\", \"This might be a long review but I have to say that this is amazing! There is a learning curve with it and I'll admit at first I was getting discouraged because with my first two cycles with the diva cup, I had leaks. Removing it for the first time felt like I was pulling out my insides because I didn't break the seal properly lol I just couldn't seem to get it right no matter what I did. However, with more practice, I noticed near the end of my second cycle the leaks disappeared and by the third cycle with the cup, I had not a single leak!!!!!! It was an amazing feeling to not use a single tampon or pad and be able to go 12 hours without changing anything! I researched different folds and methods that could work and I finally figured out the proper placement for my body to avoid leaks. I'm thrilled!! And would highly recommend it! My advice would be to be patient! Keep practicing! At first I thought it was never going to be a success for me and I've had complete success with my third cycle with the diva cup.\", \"If you've been considering making the change to the Diva Cup, don't think anymore and just do it! I bought my Diva Cup and put off using it for almost a YEAR because of how nervous I was to make the transition from tampons. I've now been using the cup for the past 5 months, and I have been raving about it to all of my girlfriends. No wet tampon string to mess with, no worrying about keeping it in for too long, no risk of TSS, no negative environmental effects, no more post-period yeast infections; the Diva Cup has completed changed my mentality around my periods. Once you get past the initial learning curve, there is no denying how fantastic this product is. Insert, remove, empty, and pop back in! Wear a panty liner to catch any leaks (especially when you're first learning how to use it) and you're good to go.

It really is less gross overall than pads and tampons, let me tell you, and you do feel so much cleaner throughout your period! And it reduces cramps, too. I love that I’m not creating landfill waste, too, with single-use products. No leaks or issues yet other than the first few days of discomfort...every person will find a way to fold the cup for easy insertion that’s best for their body. I haven’t tried the Flex discs yet, but I’m really enjoying my cup so far!', 'I only bought this for the discs (I used Softdiscs before but they leaked, so I wanted to try these because I hate tampons), but I tried the cup first to see if it would work. I wasn’t expecting much because I had used another brand before and it was too big for me and very uncomfortable. I put this one in overnight and had not a drop of leakage on my heaviest period day. I wore it again for the next 3 days and same deal. I can feel it a little bit when I first move up or down (as opposed to the discs that I can’t feel at all), but the money saving, sustainability, and leak protection make it well worth it. One important note: no your body when you order this. I am 38 years old and have had two children, one within the last year (although both were delivered via C-section), and this is *definitely* the fit for me, not the bigger one. The cup I had used in the past was the post 30 post childbearing size and it didn’t fit well at all.']}, {'keyword': 'Menstrual Cup, Model 2 feminine care', 'name': 'Saalt Menstrual Cup - Himalayan Pink - Small', 'brand': 'Saalt', 'url': 'https://www.target.com/p/saalt-menstrual-cup-himalayan-pink-small/-/A-75663408', 'pic': 'https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_4624b998-a4d2-4ef9-85c7-ff9bd62a5480', 'price': 32.99, 'category': ['Personal Care', 'Feminine Products'], 'star_ratings': [4.87, 79], 'other_ratings': {'absorbency': 4.87, 'comfort_1': 4.76, 'odorControl': 4.89, 'Value': 4.82, 'Quality': 4.98}, 'at_a_glance': 'NA', 'highlights': ['Premium menstrual cup for light to regular flow', '2 to 3 tampon capacity', '12 hours of protection day & night', 'Lasts 10 years', 'Designed for comfort', 'Chemical & toxin free', 'Better for your body & the environment', 'Includes one cup + one carry bag'], 'specifications': {}, 'description': \"The Small Saalt Cup is the perfect starter cup to simplify and improve your period.

Thank you for (period) caring! \", 'reviews': ['There definitely is a learning curve to using this product or any mentrual cup. So I definitely recommend watching how-to videos to teach you how to insert and remove the cup. I would also highly recommend not trimming the stem if you’re a first time user until you’ve actually gotten the hang of the insertion and removal process (I cut mine too early, not realizing I hadn’t been pushing the cup in all the way although it didn’t cause problems, it did make it a little harder to find at first when I was ready to remove the cup). As messy as the whole “mentrual cup” idea sounds at first, once I started using this product, I realized that it’s actually less messy than using tampons and pads. Not to mention, it’s so much more time efficient because you don’t have to run to the bathroom ever 3 hours just to change it out like a pad or tampon.Overall, this product is phenomenal! I don’t get any cramping. I can’t even tell I’m wearing it. And there’s no leakage! Most of all, I love the fact that this is a great feminine product that reduces environmental waste and the company gives back to other women in need. Tip: you should not be able to feel the cup, if you do, try reinserting it with the punch down fold and make sure to push it pass your PELVIC BONE. If you can feel it, chances are, you didn’t push it in far enough.', \"First of all, get yourself on the Saalt facebook page. People with periods are giving amazing advice on that page.  Pros- 1-great packaging. It makes me happy just to look at it. 2- It totally works3- great instructions4- easy to insert (all the reviews scared the hellouta me, but it was easy peasy lemon squeezie). 5- You don't feel it6- doesn't cause additional cramps even though it's bigger than any tampon I've ever tried. 7- good for the environment. Cons and some advice1- It makes a mess on your hands when you pull it out, it doesn't matter what people say. Be prepared2- It's kind of a challenge to pull out. Now I'm on my first cycle using this, so it may get easier the more experience I have. Advice- don't use lube if it hurts to get out. There's no way of getting it out when it's slippery. Keep the tail on until you are certain you don't need it.3- It makes family members wonder what you're doing in the bathroom as you laugh at the gross sounds that happen while using this thing. 4- Kind of wish it was cheaper.  Saalt's website sells them for a few dollars cheaper with free shipping. I think I might try the new soft version that came out just recently. This one isn't hard or anything, but man it hurts to pull out.  I also first ordered the blue one, and decided to return it and get the pink small. I've had 3 kids but I was still nervous to put something so big up there and expect to not get major cramps. I'm glad I got the small. It has never been full. There you have it. My review about my monthly cycle for all to see.\", 'Bought the cup to reduce environmental waste and save money. If you follow the different techniques for insertion it’s fairly easy, you may need to adjust to have it in more once it’s in so the stem isn’t sticking out as that can be uncomfortable. I don’t feel it at all once it’s in. Also can be uncomfortable to take out just make sure you move side to side and then tip it forward. I wear small and leave it in all day and just clean it when I take a shower, makes it really easy. The best is you clean it then wear it through the night!

Rich flavor and smooth texture, especially if made with milk for more nutrition; no graininess. I mix mine up in a measuring cup and let the batter sit to absorb the liquid while I scramble eggs, then wipe out the non-stick skillet with a paper towel and fry the pancakes in it. No mess, quick and easy. No need to use any oil. I like to add a smidge of cinnamon and sugar to the batter, too. Only problem is Target is often out of stock - please stock more, Target.', \"Was on the hunt for gluten free organic pancake mix after a failed attempt to make my own from scratch. Though not USDA Organic, these have a different certification, which sadly and strangely has been the best I can find. Honestly, my expectations were low, but MAN these are good. First off, very easy to make. Couldn't be easier. Was almost weirded out by how easy (just add water?) but they turned out amazing. Each one came out perfect...even the first pancake...and they were thin but light and fluffy and, the best part, the crispy edges. So pleasantly surprised. I cooked them in avocado oil, so I can only imagine how tasty they'd be with butter. There were two other people (who don't have to go gluten free) I served them to who loved them as well. Now a pantry staple.\", \"It's delicious! Has that chewiness. Cook with butter for some crispiness on the outside. I made mine with semi sweet chocolate chips. They are so good to eat by themselves without syrup or strawberries! Being gluten free with this mix is easy. Just a little pricey for the pack as you can only make a few pancakes out of it.\"]}, {'keyword': 'Mixed Berry Crunch Protein Oatmeal hot cereal pancake mixes', 'name': 'Birch Benders Paleo Pancake Mix - 12oz', 'brand': 'Birch Benders', 'url': 'https://www.target.com/p/birch-benders-paleo-pancake-mix-12oz/-/A-52103633', 'pic': 'https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_42adafe4-b0c0-48bc-898b-a616884cdf27', 'price': 4.99, 'category': ['Grocery', 'Breakfast & Cereal', 'Pancake Mixes, Waffle Mixes & Syrup'], 'star_ratings': [4.05, 20], 'other_ratings': {'Value': 4.5, 'Taste': 4.38, 'Quality': 4.31}, 'at_a_glance': 'NA', 'highlights': ['Wild ingredients from around the globe', 'Non-GMO, Certified Gluten Free, Certified Kosher', 'Low Glycemic, Dairy Free, Grain Free, Soy Free', 'Easy to make: add water, mix and cook', 'Easier, healthier & tastier'], 'specifications': {'Contains': ' Almonds, Eggs', 'State of Readiness': ' Mix', 'Store': ' Room Temperature', 'Package Quantity': ' 1', 'Package type': ' Individual Item Multi-Serving', 'Net weight': ' 12 ounces'}, 'description': \"Birch Bender's Paleo Pancakes Taste like your grandma made them!
